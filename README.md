# SingBiker

This is a software enginnering course project, used to design routes and navigate when users want to cycle around Singapore. The most charming feature of our app is that it uses a novel algorithm to compute the best route for cycling, taking the PCN (park connecter network) in Singapore into account.

Here is the demo video for this app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iixvHfOsals

# 骑行新加坡

这是一款用于给骑行者设计路线以及导航的app。它可以为骑行者提供很多便利，包涵天气预报、路况预警等功能，最关键的是它在设计路线时，尽可能地考虑到与PCN路线的重合度。
