# SingBiker
This is a software enginnering course project, used to design routes and navigate when users want to cycle around Singapore. The most charming feature of our app is that it uses a novel algorithm to compute the best route for cycling, taking the PCN (park connecter network) in Singapore into account.
Here is the demo video for this app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iixvHfOsals
